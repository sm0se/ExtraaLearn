# ExtraaLearn: Lead Conversion Prediction and Analysis

ExtraaLearn is an EdTech startup helping students and professionals upskill through cutting-edge technology programs. With a large volume of leads generated through various marketing channels, the company aims to identify which leads are more likely to convert to paying customers. This project uses machine learning to predict lead conversion and identify key factors driving customer acquisition.

## Objective

- **Predict** which leads are most likely to convert into paid customers.
- **Identify** factors influencing lead conversion.
- **Create a profile** of leads most likely to convert.

## Approach

We use **Logistic Regression** for classification and **Linear Regression** for quantifying the factors influencing lead conversion.

### 1. **Logistic Regression**
Logistic regression is used to classify leads into two categories: likely to convert or unlikely to convert. The model outputs probabilities based on historical lead data.

- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and transform data for model training.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assess model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC (Area Under Curve).

### 2. **Linear Regression**
Linear regression helps in identifying the continuous factors influencing conversion likelihood, such as engagement levels or time spent interacting with the platform.

- **Model Fitting:** Predict conversion scores based on lead features.
- **Insights:** Identify which features drive higher conversion likelihood.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Collection & Cleaning:** Gather and clean lead data (handle missing values, outliers, etc.).
2. **Feature Engineering:** Extract meaningful features like lead source and engagement score.
3. **Model Training:**
   - Logistic regression for binary classification.
   - Linear regression for understanding the impact of continuous factors.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Measure performance and optimize models.
5. **Insights & Recommendations:** Provide a profile of high-conversion leads and key influencing factors.

## Conclusion

This project enables ExtraaLearn to allocate resources efficiently by focusing on high-potential leads, improving conversion rates, and making data-driven decisions to boost customer acquisition.
